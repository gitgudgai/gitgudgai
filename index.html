<h2> Gai's 10 Formative Cinematic Experiences </h2> 
<h3>Who's this Gai?</h3>
I'm a very new (but not so young) coder. I had terrible learning experiences and difficulty with coding when I was younger (partly my fault) and I am in between jobs right now. So I thought I would start making websites as a way to teach myself new skills and get over my past hangups/trauma. I am also a Filipino martial artist and teacher. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this little page on movies I learned a lot from which I've put together. Send me a message by clicking <a href= "mailto:gaiusraelsison@yahoo.com">here</a>.

    My first Studio Ghibli film, I saw it on VHS (when that was the most common media format). I was blown away by the uncensored depictions of action and violence, and I loved the powerful roles held by the female characters and nature, without making the men seem weaker.

    A sci-fi action film that helped shape my perspectives on the world around us. Aside from the action, the moments of Neo's growth and development were undoubtedly spellbinding. It was such a thrill to see martial arts used and portrayed in a totally organic way.

    A slow burning film that really left an impact on how power corrupts and what it means to be family. My first watch didn't really impress me a lot - I read Mario Puzo's books and found more to see when I rewatched it. It was a really nice look at power dynamics and unseen forms of communication.

    A violent and disturbing thriller that played with the ideas of human existence and love and the cost of it all. Such a messed up plot and an amazing interpretation of manga, I was in a phase of enjoying Korean culture in the late 2000s and this reinforced it.

    A really good introduction to the mindset that life is only given meaning by those who live it. I don't remember watching it with others but I do know that the scene where the protagonist gets mugged left a lasting impression on me.

    Animated film with a lot more of what I enjoy. Set in a dystopian world ruled by the undead, a halfbreed vampire makes his way around the galaxy trying to escape his fate but ultimately confronting it. Studio MadHouse, which makes and animates some of the best anime, really produced a gothic gem in this.

</br></br>
    In my opinion, the best of the Evil Dead franchise, with all the best elements of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. I saw bits of it as a kid, got hooked by the gore and the horror, and the sucker punch of humor that you can't help but chuckle at.

</br></br>
    One of the few historical Filipino films that I was able to finish. It portrays the final days of the patriot Macario Sakay, his betrayal by Filipinos and execution by American forces. It was a great introduction to my developing brain, giving me pause to think about how the people in power never really take power without destroying lives.

    An excellent production of the comic that really came together wonderfully. The voice of Hugo Weaving's performance still plays in my memory.

    A world where the rich tread on the poor from birth by design, this film was definitely an early influence on my views on how society feeds itself on the weakest of us.
